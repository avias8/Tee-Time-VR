                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>This Privacy Policy outlines the privacy practices for the game "Tee Time VR," developed by Avi Varma. My commitment is to your privacy, and this policy is simple: I do not collect your data.</p>

                <h3>No Data Collection</h3>
                <p>"Tee Time VR" does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information or gameplay data. I do not use any analytics or advertising services. Your gameplay is your own.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> The game does not ask for, access, or store your name, email address, or any other personal details.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Usage Data:</strong> The game does not collect metrics on how you play, how long you play, or your performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Device Information:</strong> The game does not collect any information about your device, such as IP address or device identifiers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Third-Party Platforms</h3>
                <p>Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not cover the data collection practices of the virtual reality platform on which you purchase and play "Tee Time VR" (e.g., Meta Quest Store, SteamVR). These platforms have their own privacy policies, and I encourage you to review them to understand how they handle your data.</p>
                
                <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
                <p>Consistent with the policy of not collecting any data, this game does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13.</p>

                <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>If I ever update this policy, I will post the new policy on this page and change the effective date at the top.</p>
