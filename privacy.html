                This policy covers: Tee-Time VR for Meta Quest.</p>

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>"Tee Time VR" is developed and published by Avi Varma, a solo developer doing business as Fiskar Varmations ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains what
                information we process when you play Tee Time VR, why we process it, and the choices you have regarding that
                information. Meta may ask you to review this policy before granting access to certain platform features, such as
                multiplayer services.</p>

                <h3>Information We Process</h3>
                <p>We process only the information that is necessary to operate the game, deliver platform features, and provide
                support. We do not sell your information or use it for advertising.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Meta account information.</strong> When you sign in through the Meta platform, we receive your Meta
                    (Oculus) user ID, display name, and profile image. We use this information to authenticate you, show your
                    profile to other players in lobbies and leaderboards, and to enable friend invites and matchmaking provided by
                    the Meta platform.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gameplay and progression data.</strong> We store your local player preferences, achievements, and leaderboard scores so the game can save your progress, present rankings, and
                    prevent cheating. When you participate in multiplayer matches, your shot data and voice-chat participation are
                    transmitted in real time to the other players in the session.</li>
                    <li><strong>Support information.</strong> If you contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@avivarma.ca">privacy@avivarma.ca</a>
                    we will process the email address, message contents, and any attachments you choose to send so that we can
                    respond to your request.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
                <p>We use the information described above to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create and maintain multiplayer lobbies, leaderboards, and other social gameplay features;</li>
                    <li>Synchronize gameplay data across your devices when you use your Meta account;</li>
                    <li>Provide customer support and respond to your requests;</li>
                    <li>Monitor performance, detect bugs, and protect the Service against abuse.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Legal Basis</h3>
                <p>We process your information because it is necessary to perform the contract with you (the End User License
                Agreement governing access to Tee Time VR), to provide the platform features you request, and to comply with our
                legitimate interests in operating a secure and fair game environment. Where required, we rely on your consentâ€”for
                example, when you opt in to voice chat during a multiplayer session.</p>

                <h3>Data Storage and Retention</h3>
                <p>Your profile, leaderboard scores, and gameplay history are stored securely on Meta-hosted services and within your
                device storage. We retain this information while you maintain an active Tee Time VR profile. Diagnostic logs are
                retained for up to 12 months unless we need them longer to investigate an issue. Support correspondence is retained
                for as long as necessary to resolve your request and to comply with legal obligations.</p>

                <h3>Sharing Your Information</h3>
                <p>We do not share your personal information with independent third parties. Meta Platforms, Inc. processes the data
                described above as part of providing platform services such as account authentication, matchmaking, and cloud
                storage. Multiplayer participants can see your display name, avatar, voice chat audio (if enabled), and gameplay
                actions during a session.</p>

                <h3>Your Rights and Choices</h3>
                <p>All players, regardless of where they live, may request access to, correction of, or deletion of their personal
                information. To exercise these rights, email us at the address below with your Meta display name or user ID so that we
                can verify your account. You can also review or update certain account details directly through your Meta account
                settings. When you ask us to delete your Tee Time VR profile, we will coordinate with Meta to remove stored data
                associated with your user ID and confirm once the deletion is complete. We do not charge any fees for handling privacy
                requests.</p>

                <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
                <p>Tee Time VR is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly process personal information from
                children under 13. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we
                can take appropriate action.</p>

                <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post the updated policy
                here and revise the effective date. Continued use of Tee Time VR after the changes become effective means you accept
                the updated policy.</p>

                <h3>Contact Us</h3>
                <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to exercise your privacy rights, please contact Avi
